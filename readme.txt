Social Sharing Buttons (SSB) extension for the WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) plugin.

== Description ==

The WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (SSB) plugin works in conjunction with [WPSSO](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/), extending WPSSO's existing settings with additional pages, tabs, and options with social sharing button features.

These new settings allow you to include a selection of social sharing buttons in several locations:

* Above and/or below your content and/or excerpt text.
* On admin editing pages, including media, product pages, and custom post types.
* On [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single pages.
* On [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activity entries.
* In a WordPress sharing widget.
* In a CSS / javascript button sidebar.
* From a shortcode within your content and/or excerpt.
* From a function in your theme's template(s).

Each of the following social sharing buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* Buffer
* Facebook (Like, Send, and Share)
* Google+
* LinkedIn
* ManageWP
* Pinterest
* Reddit
* StumbleUpon
* Tumblr (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* Twitter (Summary, Large Image Summary, Photo, Gallery, Player and Product Cards)

The Facebook, Google+ and Twitter sharing buttons also support *multiple languages*, and the language can match the webpage language (WordPress locale) dynamically. WPSSO SSB can also include hashtags (from WordPress and/or NextGEN Gallery tag names) in Tweet texts and other social captions.

**Please note that [WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO)](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/) version 2.6.1+ is required to use this WPSSO extension.**
