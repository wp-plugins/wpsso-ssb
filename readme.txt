== Description ==

<p><img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-ssb/assets/icon-256x256.png" width="256" height="256" style="width:33%;min-width:128px;max-width:256px;float:left;margin:0 40px 20px 0;" />Add traditional social sharing buttons from social websites to Posts / Pages, Custom Post Types, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/">bbPress</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/">BuddyPress</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a> product pages, and many more. The sharing buttons can be included in the content, excerpt, widget, CSS floating sidebar, and on admin editing pages.</p>

<p>WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (WPSSO SSB) works in conjunction with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO)</a> plugin, extending its features with additional settings pages, tabs, and options to provide traditional social sharing buttons. WPSSO SSB sources the JavaScript provided by each social website asynchronously and &mdash; using WPSSO as its framework &mdash; provides customized and accurate information about your content to social websites.</p>

= Quick List of Features =

WPSSO SSB allows you to include a selection of traditional social sharing buttons in multiple locations:
